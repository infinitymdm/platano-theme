Summary
-------

* Do not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files and process
  them with SASS (running `make` should do that when you have the required
  software installed, as described below; run `/.parse-sass.sh` manually
  if it doesn't).

How to tweak the theme
----------------------

Platano is a complex theme, so to keep it maintainable it's written and
processed in SASS, the generated CSS is then transformed into a gresource
file during gtk build and used at runtime in a non-legible or editable form.

It is very likely your change will happen in the _widgets.scss file.
That's where all the widget selectors are defined.
Here's a rundown of the "supporting" stylesheets, that are unlikely to be the
right place for a drive by stylesheet fix:

_colors.scss        - global color definitions. We keep the number of defined
                      colors to a necessary minimum, most colors are derived
                      from a handful of basics. It is an exact copy of the
                      gtk counterpart. Light theme is used for the classic
                      theme and dark is for GNOME3 shell default.

_drawing.scss       - drawing helper mixings/functions to allow easier
                      definition of widget drawing under specific context.
                      This is why Platano isn't 15000 LOC.

_widgets.scss       - actual definitions of style for each widget. This is
                      where you are likely to add/remove your changes.
