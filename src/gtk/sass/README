Summary
-------

* Do not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files and process them
  with SASS (run `./parse-sass.sh` when you have the required software
  installed, as described below).

How to tweak the theme
----------------------

Plata is a complex theme, so to keep it maintainable it's written and
processed in SASS. The generated CSS is then transformed into a gresource
file during gtk build and used at runtime in a non-legible or editable form.

The 'parse-sass.sh' requires a development package of libgtk-3.0 to check
the current version of Gtk 3.x via pkg-config. Or simply run
'./parse-sass.sh -a' to generate all of Gtk versioned CSSs.

It is very likely your change will happen in the _common.scss file.
That's where all the widget selectors are defined.
Here's a rundown of the "supporting" stylesheets, that are unlikely to be the
right place for a drive by stylesheet fix:

_colors.scss        - global color definitions. We keep the number of defined
                      colors to a necessary minimum, most colors are derived
                      form a handful of basics. It covers both the light
                      variant and the dark variant.

_colors-public.scss - SCSS colors exported through gtk to allow for 3rd party
                      apps color mixing.

_drawing.scss       - drawing helper mixings/functions to allow easier
                      definition of widget drawing under specific context.
                      This is why Plata isn't 15000 LOC.

_common.scss        - actual definitions of style for each widget. This is
                      where you are likely to add/remove your changes.

_misc.scss          - some apps-specifc styling for miscellaneous
                      'GNOME hosted' apps.

_3rd_party.scss     - apps-specific and DE-specific styling for
                      'non-GNOME' apps and DEs.

You can read about SASS at http://sass-lang.com/documentation/. Once you make
your changes to the _common.scss file, you can either run the ./parse-sass.sh
script.
