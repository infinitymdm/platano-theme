# Platano Notes Apr 23 2022

Today I got in touch with GZGavinZhao. He's said he'll open a pull request to incorporate his CMake tooling into Platano. We're off to a good start.

In other news, I need to get things organized. Let's start off by adding a new README and making issues for the problems I've inherited from Plata.

I did quite a bit of tweaking to the README and not a lot of work on the code... but hey, you win some and you lose some. Maybe tomorrow will be better for code.
