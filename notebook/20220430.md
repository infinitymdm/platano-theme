## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Continuing my theme of attempting to match the Budgie built-in theme's Sass in _main.scss, today we're looking at the `.budgie-session-dialog` selector. 

So first off, I have some code for this selector in two different files. There's some inherited styling for buttons in _notifications.scss that probably should be moved into the _buttons file. Let's start there.

Ok, now we're digging into the dialog styling. We have three separate dialog selectors with some common elements: `.budgie-session-dialog`, `.budgie-run-dialog`, and `.budgie-polkit-dialog`. I'll begin the styling work by making a new placeholder for the common styling.

I've spent a very long time doing very little today. (There are lots of distractions). We'll test these changes tomorrow.
