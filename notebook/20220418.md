# Platano Notes Apr 18 2022

## Goals for Today
Today we're looking at those notifications again. I had to track down some issues with the $foreground variables, but now that I've fixed those (after much pain & suffering) I can get back to work. 

## Experimentation & Results
To review, here's how notifications used to look:

And here's how they look at [this commit](https://github.com/infinitymdm/platano-theme/commit/6f33c02cd1d03054481138ec02f799b6ff33842d), where I've edited one of the radii from r_4 to r_8:

It looks like this didn't change the radius I wanted. I tweaked the wrong parameters, it seems.

I've reverted those changes. I'm going to check against EbonJaeger's patch to see what he changed, and see if perhaps I messed up when I integrated the patch. 

I think I did mess up the patch. That's fixed now, it doesn't seem to change anything:

Unfortunately that's all the time I have for tonight. I'll have to tackle this again tomorrow.
