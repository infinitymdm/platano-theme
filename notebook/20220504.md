# Platano Notes May 4 2022

## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Today our task is the alt-tab switcher, aka `.budgie-switcher-window`. Let's get started.

> A side note: perhaps I should be using my mixins to pass in the `-gtk` effect names and values. That might make things reasonable once I get around to the gtk/_common.scss file. 

Alt-tab switcher was fairly mundane. ~~I thing I'm going to move on and do another one or two tonight as well.~~

I allowed myself to be distracted by lots of things and am now out of time for tonight. Maybe next time.
