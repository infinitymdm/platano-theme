## GTK Breakout (continued)
It's again been a few days since I looked at this, but today I think we can finally wrap up this story. I've almost finished breaking this out into smaller pieces. Today maybe be I can even merge that PR.

Our topic of attention today is the _common.scss file under /src/shell/sass. Let's get started.

That was actually fairly painless to split out into smaller files. Let's push this up and test.

It took a bit of experimentation, but things are working. PR complete! I've also managed to restore the history I lost from tista500's repo, so things are in great shape!

Let's get started on the next task: notifications.

## Notifications

As a reminder, here's how things look right now:

Right off the bat, I'm noticing that `budgie-osd-window` is styled with `border-radius: $r_8`. I wonder what happens if I change that? Let's find out!

Here's how that looks:

The vars I changed appear to just modify the corner radius. Let's put those back the way they were.

I figure the thing I'm looking for is probably some sort of margin or padding. So let's try changing `margin: $shadow_margin_3` to `$shadow_margin_2`.

After that adjustment, here's how it looks:

That doesn't appear to change anything. Not sure why.

I do also notice the shadow on the close button is incorrect. I got lucky to capture that in my screenshot.
