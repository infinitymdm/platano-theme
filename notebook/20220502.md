# Platano Notes May 2 2022

## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Well, that was a very busy weekend. I hardly got to touch this stuff. Let's pick up where we left off by doing a bit of testing.

I had to fix a couple of typos, but things look perfect! The run, polkit, and session dialogs all look exactly as they should. So far so good!

I'm going to be done with this for the night, but I'd like to make a few notes here first. I think I ought to decide on a consistent way to do the mixins, and I'm leaning towards this structure:

```
.class-selector {
    @include class_selector(param1, param2);
}
```

Currently I have some items which have the class selector in main, and some which are just includes. I can make my code much more consistent by sticking with a single style, so that's what I'm going to do here.
