## Budgie Breakout (continued)

Today I'm continuing the work on breaking out Budgie's elements. Today's subject: "Places". 

This is a widget I've never used. So let's take a look. Here's the current appearance:

One problem I notice now: the borders of the Places button aren't rounded correctly. Let's see what we can do about that.

Well, I haven't addressed the button roundness yet, but I'm pretty sure it's referenced by the `button.image-button` selector. What I have done is change `list` to `.places-list`.

After doing this, here's the result:

(If you're wondering why the items are different, it's because this was taken on a VM I'm using for testing.)

So far so good. Now back to the corner roundness. I've noticed this `@include radius(0);` under the `button:not(.image-button)` selector. That seems highly suspect, so I'm going to try removing it to see what happens.

Removing the `radius` bit has rounded the corners as expected. I'm not sure why that was in there, as it kind of looked terrible. But now it's better. :)
