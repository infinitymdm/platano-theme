## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Today I'm picking up right where I left off. First order of business is to work on reorganizing the budgie code into something a bit better, and maybe work in some of the budgie-desktop mixins.

I implemented the budgie-desktop mixin for budgie-panel with some difficulty. I had to add the widgets class as well, and its dependencies, but I was able to do most of this by commenting out a lot of stuff. 

The theme is working well with the mixin. I think my current course of action will be to continue down this path.
