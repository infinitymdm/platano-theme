## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Today I'm picking up with the menu file mixins. That includes a mixin for budgie_menu_button and budgie_user_menu. Let's get things started.

* * *

Ok, so I've changed those two items into mixins, and moved the placeholder for budgie_trigger_button into a _button.scss file. 

Here's how the indicator menu looks now:

And here it is after the updates:

~~Looks perfect!~~

It turns out I forgot to switch the theme when I took that second screenshot. Whoops.

Here's what it actually looks like:

Notice we lost the nice outline. Not sure what did that, but that's what I have source control for! I'll dig in a bit and see.

...Although I admit I'm kind of partial to the style without the outline. Maybe it would be better to just change the foreground color to be a bit lighter and call it good?

Perhaps I've found the culprit! I swapped the @include for button with the border setting (see [this diff](https://github.com/infinitymdm/platano-theme/commit/27d8c880cca1e4e32556376dd35f6447cee6927f#diff-117f1c46caf44dbbfdc3a55274974b97fdf65dc12bde96bffbdc505e39a8e40d) for details). Let's swap that back and see what it does.

Something else I've just noticed - the icons in the taskbar are *ever so slightly* more spaced out with Platano than with Plata. I won't consider this a regression, but I wish I had caught it when it happened. 

And there we have it. Looks like my hunch was correct.

With that, I think I'll call it a day. Tomorrow I'll continue breaking stuff into bite-size chunks. Some of these classes are massive, and I don't want to have to deal with these walls of code. Onward!

* * *

Ok, ok, I know I said I was done for the day. Just one more quick note. Or, a couple notes actually.
* Note 1: Plata absolutely needs a consistent roundness setting. Stuff is all over the place. Notifications are nicely rounded, but widgets in raven aren't, and things like the user-indicator we worked on today aren't either. Some text inputs have round corners, others don't, and others still are pills instead of boxes. 
    * Budgie solves this by having a $roundness setting. For me, that currently resides in _budgie.scss and is unused. 
* Note 2: I'm definitely partial to the user-indicator without the outline. It's something I should come back and review in the future, because I think it looks great. 
    * Only problem is the poor contrast, so the color would need to be lightened quite a bit. 
    * The current styling doesn't match up with Material guidelines though, so that's a thing too.
    * My roommate says that he likes the outline :( (it's ok though, he's wrong).
