## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Today I'm picking up with the menu file mixins. That includes a mixin for budgie_menu_button and budgie_user_menu. Let's get things started.

Ok, so I've changed those two items into mixins, and moved the placeholder for budgie_trigger_button into a _button.scss file. 

Here's how the indicator menu looks now:

And here it is after the updates:

Looks perfect! 

I think I'm going to call it a day on this, as I'm rather mentally worn out. We'll come back to this tomorrow and continue breaking stuff out into mixins.
