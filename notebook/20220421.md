## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Picking up right where we left off yesterday. I'm taking a look at the `budgie-clock-applet` styling in particular, as I currently have both Budgie's styling and Plata's styling in the codebase.

### Clock Applet
Here's how it looks at present:

Keep in mind that this is in the middle of my dock. Plata has a ton of styling for this widget, and I'm not sure why. I'm going to try removing it entirely and seeing what happens.

I abandoned this after a while because our internet is down. The Cox tech is here working on fixing our signal.

### Side track: Icon Tasklist

I'm getting started on the icon tasklist. I've created an empty file for it, and I plan to migrate the relevant sass from the panel file and convert it to a budgie-style mixin.
