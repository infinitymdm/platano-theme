## Budgie Breakout (continued)
Today I'm continuing the work of splitting the Budgie code into many small modules. We're looking at the .budgie-menubar selector and styling today.

Despite my best efforts, I can't figure out what this selector is referring to. There's only a single reference to it in the entire `budgie-destop` codebase, and the Buddies of Budgie folks don't have any guesses for me either. There was a suggestion that perhaps this is a carryover for backwards compatibility. 

So the plan is to just remove it and see what happens. Here goes nothing.

Well, I've updated the styling to remove the .budgie-menubar selector and theming. Nothing appears to have changed, so I'm not sure what this was about. 

This topic is one to keep in mind in case people mention regressions. If people start having issues with something that seems like some sort of "menu bar", then future me should look here first.
