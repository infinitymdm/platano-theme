## Budgie Breakout (continued)
First things first, I've decided that the work I'm doing isn't really about fixing notifications right now so much as it is about simplifying the codebase. As such I'm renaming my branch. 

The branch has now been renamed from fix-notifications to simplify-codebase. So that's taken care of. 

I've also moved the code for the icon_tasklist out of panel and into its own file. 

An idea I had today: don't use any selectors more specific than what budgie uses. That might help keep things maintainable.

Ok, now let's get to work.

### Reorganizing code
Let's establish an ordering for things. I want to make sure that mixins come first in my codebase. Budgie does this by having each module with a mixin in its own file, and then there's a main file that uses all the include rules. I think I'd like to do something similar.

I've now got things split out. So now I can begin the process of creating all the individual mixins and transferring things to the main file.
