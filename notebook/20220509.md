## GTK Breakout
Continuing on towards the goal of completion by the end of the month, today we're working on the components of the main GTK theming. Let's get to work.

The plan is to just split all the labeled stuff out into individual files. Unfortunately some of these will still be massive (looking at you _buttons.scss) but it's way better than all of it in one module.

That was kinda exhausting. I just took care of splitting them into separate files, and I'll deal with formatting and syntax later. Let's see if this thing works.
